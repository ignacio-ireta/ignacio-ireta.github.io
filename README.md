## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### **Automatic GitHub Pages Deployment**
The website is configured for automatic deployment via GitHub Pages:

1. **Push to Repository**: All changes pushed to the main branch trigger automatic deployment
2. **Configuration**: The `_config.yml` file configures Jekyll to serve from the `docs/` directory
3. **Live Site**: Once deployed, the site will be available at `https://ignacio-ireta.github.io`

### **Manual GitHub Pages Setup** (if needed)
1. Go to your repository settings on GitHub
2. Navigate to "Pages" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose "main" branch and "/docs" folder
5. Click "Save"

### **Local Development**
To run the website locally:
```bash
cd docs
python -m http.server 8000
# Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```
