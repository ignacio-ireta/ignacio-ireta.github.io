                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Reed RSVP Reader ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy.
                    This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Android application.
                </p>

                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>We do not collect any personal data.</strong> Reed is designed with privacy in mind:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your books and documents are stored <strong>only on your device</strong></li>
                    <li>Reading progress and preferences are saved <strong>locally</strong></li>

            <section>
                <h2>Data Storage</h2>
                <p>
                    All data associated with your use of Reed—including imported books, reading progress,
                    and settings—is stored exclusively on your device's local storage. We have no access
                    to this data, and it is never transmitted to any external servers.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>
                    Reed is distributed through the Google Play Store. Google may collect certain data
                    as part of their standard services (such as crash reports and basic usage statistics).
                    This is governed by
                    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy
                        Policy</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app itself does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
                <p>
                    We do not share, sell, or transfer any user data to third parties. Since we don't
                    collect data in the first place, there is nothing to share.
                </p>
            </section>

                <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>
                    Reed does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. The app
                    can be safely used by users of all ages as it does not collect any personal data.
                </p>

                <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
                <p>
                    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted
