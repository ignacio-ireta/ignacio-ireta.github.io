# Project Showcase Website: Requirements

This document outlines the requirements for a demonstration website to be hosted on GitHub Pages. The purpose of the website is to effectively showcase the results of a project. The design will be modern, engaging, and performance-conscious, ensuring it runs smoothly on a variety of devices.

## 1. Core Goal

The primary goal is to create a flexible and compelling single-page website to present project results. The structure should be modular, allowing for dummy content to be easily replaced with the actual project's outputs once they are available.

## 2. Guiding Principles

*   **Performance First:** The website must be lightweight and fast. The total page weight should be minimized, and it should remain responsive on devices with average specs (e.g., 8GB RAM).
*   **Lazy Loading:** All heavy assets (images, videos, 3D models, interactive plots) must be lazy-loaded to ensure a fast initial page load.
*   **Modularity:** The site will be built in distinct sections, each showcasing a different type of result. This allows for easy updates and content management.
*   **Interactivity:** Where possible, results should be presented interactively to engage the user (e.g., interactive plots, model viewers, before/after sliders).

## 3. Website Structure & Layout (Single-Page)

The website will be a single, vertically scrolling page with a sticky navigation bar for easy navigation between sections.

### 3.1. Header & Navigation
- A fixed (sticky) navigation bar at the top of the page.
- **Contents:**
    - Project Title
    - Navigation links: `Abstract`, `Results`, `Live Demo`, `About`, `Code`.
    - Link to the project's GitHub repository.

### 3.2. Hero Section
- A visually striking section to immediately capture user attention.
- **Contents:**
    - Main Project Title and a one-sentence tagline.
    - Key achievements presented as large, bold metrics (KPIs).
    - A high-quality, looping background video or GIF to showcase the most compelling result.

### 3.3. Abstract & Overview
- A section to provide context and a high-level overview.
- **Contents:**
    - A short textual summary (2-3 paragraphs).
    - A flowchart or diagram visualizing the project's methodology.
    - A link to the full research paper or a detailed document (e.g., PDF).

### 3.4. Results Showcase
- A detailed section to present the evidence, with each component being lazy-loaded.
- This section will be a collection of sub-sections for different result formats:
    - **Visual Comparison:** Before & After image sliders.
    - **Gallery:** An image carousel or masonry grid.
    - **Quantitative Analysis:**
        - Interactive charts/plots (e.g., using Chart.js).
        - A sortable and filterable data table for raw numbers.
    - **3D Models:** An interactive 3D model viewer (e.g., Google `<model-viewer>`).
    - **Video Demo:** An embedded video player (e.g., from YouTube/Vimeo).
    - **GIFs:** Showcase short, looping results.

### 3.5. Live Interactive Demo
- An interactive module that allows users to try a simplified version of the project in their browser.
- **Functionality:**
    - User input (e.g., text area, file upload).
    - An output display area to show the real-time result.
    - *Note: This will depend on the feasibility of running a lightweight model client-side.*

### 3.6. Code & Implementation Details
- A section for technical audiences.
- **Contents:**
    - Syntax-highlighted code snippets of key algorithms.
    - A side-by-side "diff" view for text transformation tasks if applicable.

### 3.7. About & Citation
- A section to credit the creators.
- **Contents:**
    - Profiles of team members with links.
    - A pre-formatted citation block for academic use.

### 3.8. Footer
- A simple footer at the bottom of the page.
- **Contents:**
    - Copyright information.
    - A link back to the GitHub repository.
    - A "Back to Top" navigation link.
